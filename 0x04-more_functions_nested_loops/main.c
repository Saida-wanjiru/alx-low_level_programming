#include "main.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    Point p;
    p.x = 10;
    p.y = 20;

    printf("Max value: %d\n", MAX_VALUE);

Compile and Run:
When you compile your program, make sure to include all the necessary source files, including the .c files that correspond to the functions declared in the main.h header.

Assuming you have a main.c and a functions.c file where the function implementations are present, you can compile and link them using the following command:

css
Copy code
gcc main.c functions.c -o my_program
Then, run your program:

bash
Copy code
./my_program
By using a main.h header file, you can avoid duplicating function prototypes, macros, and other declarations across multiple source files. This makes your code more organized, maintainable, and easier to understand.

how to create main.c
ChatGPT
Creating a main.c file involves creating the main entry point for your C program. This is where the execution of your program begins. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a main.c file:

Create the File:
Start by creating a new file named main.c in your desired directory. You can use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to create the file.

Write the main Function:
Inside the main.c file, you'll define the main function. This function is the entry point for your program and will be executed first when you run your program. Here's a basic example:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
In this example, the printf function is used to print "Hello, world!" to the standard output. The return 0; statement indicates that the program executed successfully.

Compile and Run:
Once you've written the main.c file, you need to compile it into an executable program. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing main.c, then use a C compiler like gcc to compile the file:

css
Copy code
gcc main.c -o my_program
This command will generate an executable file named my_program.

Run the Program:
After compiling the program, you can run it using the following command:

bash
Copy code
./my_program
You should see the output "Hello, world!" displayed in the terminal.

Adding More Code:
You can add more code to your main.c file to build more complex programs. This might include function calls, variable declarations, control flow statements (if, loops), and more.

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1 = 5;
    int num2 = 7;
    int sum = num1 + num2;
    
    printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d.\n", num1, num2, sum);
    
    if (sum > 10) {
        printf("The sum is greater than 10.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The sum is not greater than 10.\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
Remember that the main.c file serves as the starting point for your C program. It contains the main function, where execution begins, and you can build the rest of your program's logic around it.
